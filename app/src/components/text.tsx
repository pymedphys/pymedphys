        <H3>Aim of application</H3>
        <p>
          In its current form this application takes a single Elekta Linac trf
          logfile as well as a single RT DICOM plan file that corresponds to
          the same plan as the logfile. It then process this data and creates
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decoded header and table csv files for the logfile</li>
          <li>
            The logfile mapped to a RT DICOM plan file using the provided
            DICOM file as a template (in ALPHA)
        </li>
          <li>
            A plot of the MU Density comparison between the logfile and the
            provided DICOM file
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In its current form only one Gantry angle is used within the DICOM
          file.
       </p>
        <p>
          In the future it is expected that this application will be able to
          serve as a generic file processing application for a range processing
          tasks.

          This is an example application that
        combines <a href="https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/">
            PyMedPhys
        </a> with <a href="https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide">
            pyodide
        </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This application loads Python into the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">
            wasm virtual machine
        </a> of your browser allowing Python code to be run on your local machine without
          having Python installed, or without needing Python to run on a remote.</p>
        <p>
          When it comes to sensitive information or large data files, this
          means no data needs to leave your computer, while you still get the
          convenience a web app brings in not needing to install anything on
          your PC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expect this application to freeze up, and not always work as
          expected. Both the application itself, and a key part of
          the engine that makes it work is under very much an ALPHA level of
          release. In practice this means feel free to use this application
          as a means to investigate what is possible, but do not rely on it
          to work correctly, or work at all.
       </p>

        <H2>Instructions for use</H2>
        <p>
          To begin, download <a href={demoFiles} type="application/zip">
            demo-files.zip
          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, press browse below under File Management and select the .trf
          and .dcm files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once these files have appeared within the input directory displayed
          then press "Process Files". At this point in time, unfortunately,
          the application will freeze until the processing is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the processing is complete, and the files appear within the
          output directory, press "Save Output" to download a zip of the
          contents of the output directory.
