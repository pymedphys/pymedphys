def anonymise_dicom(ds, delete_private_tags=True, tags_to_keep=None,
                    ignore_unknown_tags=False):
    r"""A simple tool to anonymise a DICOM file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds
        The DICOM file to be anonymised. `ds` must represent a valid
        DICOM file in the form of a `pydicom Dataset` - ordinarily
        returned by `pydicom.dcmread()`.

    delete_private_tags
        A boolean to flag whether or not to remove all private
        (non-standard) DICOM tags from the DICOM file. These may
        also contain identifying information. Defaults to `True`.

    tags_to_keep
        A sequence of DICOM tags to exclude from anonymisation. Empty by
        default.

    ignore_unknown_tags
        If `pydicom` has updated its DICOM dictionary, this function will raise an
        error since a new identifying tag may have been introduced. Set to `True` to
        ignore this error. Defaults to `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    ds_out
        An anonymised copy of the input DICOM file as a `pydicom Dataset`

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        Raised if `ignore_unknown_tags` is set to False and unrecognised DICOM
        tags are detected in `ds`
