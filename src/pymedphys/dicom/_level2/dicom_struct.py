    """Align a cube to a dicom structure set.

    Designed to allow arbitrary references frames within a dicom file to be
    extracted via contouring a cube.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0
        A 3x3 array with each row defining a 3-D point in space.
        These three points are used as initial conditions to search for
        a cube that fits the contours. Choosing initial values close to the
        structure set, and in the desired orientation will allow consistent
        results. See examples within
        `pymedphys.geometry.cubify_cube_definition`_ on what the effects
        of each of the three points are on the resulting cube.
    structure_name
        The DICOM label of the cube structure
    dcm_struct
        The pydicom reference to the DICOM structure file.
    quiet : bool
        Tell the function to not print anything. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    cube_definition_array
        Four 3-D points the define the vertices of the cube.

    vectors
        The vectors between the points that can be used to traverse the cube.
