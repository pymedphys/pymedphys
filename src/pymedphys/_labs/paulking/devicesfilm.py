    """  Extract a an relative-density profilee from a narrow png file.

    Source file is a full color PNG that is sufficiently narrow that
    density uniform along its short dimension. The image density along
    its long dimension is reflective of a dose distribution. Requires
    Python PIL.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : str
    step-size : float, optional
        Distance output increment in cm, defaults to 1 mm

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        Image profile as a list of (distance, density) tuples, where density
        is an average color intensity value as represented in the source file.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If image is not narrow, i.e. aspect ratio <= 5
    AssertionError
        If step_size is too small, i.e. step_size <= 12.7 / dpi
