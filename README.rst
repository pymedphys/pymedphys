Description
-----------

.. START_OF_ABOUT_IMPORT

PyMedPhys is a toolbox for Medical Physicists that we all have access to, and
we will all have access to whatever it becomes in the future. It is inspired
by our physics peers in astronomy and their `Astropy Project`_.

PyMedPhys aims to become not just a library, but instead a Medical Physics
open source `monorepo`_ where we can all store, review, use, and learn off of
each other's code. It is structured and glued together with Python, but
certainly not limited to one programming language.

.. _`monorepo`: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext

This package is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pymedphys/),
GitHub (https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys), and conda-forge
(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pymedphys). Documentation is at
https://pymedphys.com.

We want you on this list. We want you, whether you are a  clinical Medical
Physicist, PhD or Masters student, researcher, or even just someone with an
interest in Python to join our
team. We want you if you have a desire to create and validate a toolbox we can
all use to improve how we care for our patients.

The aim of PyMedPhys is that it will be developed by an open community of
contributors. We use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors
to maintain the copyright on their contributions. All code is licensed under
the AGPLv3+ with additional terms from the Apache-2.0 license.
