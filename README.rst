.. START_OF_ABOUT_IMPORT

PyMedPhys aims to be a Medical Physics open source `monorepo`_ where we can all store, review, use, and learn off of each other's code. It is a library of tools that we all have access to and, because of its `license`_, will all have access to whatever it becomes in the future. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our physics peers in astronomy and their `Astropy Project`_.

It is structured and glued together with Python, but certainly not limited to one programming language. A great place to begin sharing is the labs, a range of experimental modules where you can learn to use git and begin the process of code sharing and review. For example, feel free to submit to the labs your favorite MatLab scripts which we can help you glue together with Python using `oct2py`_.

We want you on this list. We want you, whether you are a  clinical Medical
Physicist, PhD or Masters student, researcher, or even just someone with an
interest in Python to join our
team. We want you if you have a desire to create and validate a toolbox we can
all use to improve how we care for our patients.

The aim of PyMedPhys is that it will be developed by an open community of
contributors. We use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors
