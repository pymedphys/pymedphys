  abstract={Abstract Monte Carlo (MC) independent dose calculations are often based on phase-space files (PSF), as they can accurately represent particle characteristics. PSF generally are large and create a bottleneck in computation time. In addition, the number of independent particles is limited by the PSF, preventing further reduction of statistical uncertainty. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a virtual source model (VSM) to address these limitations. Particles from existing PSF for the Varian TrueBeam medical linear accelerator 6X, 6XFFF, 10X, and 10XFFF beam configurations were tallied, analyzed, and used to generate a dual-source photon VSM that includes electron contamination. The particle density distribution, kinetic energy spectrum, particle direction, and the correlations between characteristics were computed. The VSM models for each beam configuration were validated with water phantom measurements as well as clinical test cases against the original PSF. The new VSM requires 67 MB of disk space for each beam configuration, compared to 50 GB for the PSF from which they are based and effectively remove the bottleneck set by the PSF. At 3\% MC uncertainty, the VSM approach reduces the calculation time by a factor of 14 on our server. MC doses obtained using the VSM approach were compared against PSF-generated doses in clinical test cases and measurements in a water phantom using a gamma index analysis. For all tests, the VSMs were in excellent agreement with PSF doses and measurements (>90\% passing voxels between doses and measurements). Results of this study indicate the successful derivation and implementation of a VSM model for Varian Linac that significantly saves computation time without sacrificing accuracy for independent dose calculation.}
