Get Started
==================

Install Python
==============

In order to make use of the PyMedPhys library, you'll need Python installed on
your workstation. Below are some recommended instructions for installing Python
based upon your OS.

Windows 10 or 11
----------------

Open up a command prompt and type:

.. code:: bash

    python

If python isn't already installed this will open the Windows store. At this
point you can click the "Get" button. It will ask you to sign in, but you can
skip the sign in step. It will still install.

Once installed, open a new command prompt and test that it has installed by
typing:

.. code:: bash

    python --version

Windows by default also can't utilise paths longer than 260 characters. This
will likely be an issue for installing Python packages. As such follow the
`enable Windows Long Paths guide`_ to enable long paths on your system.

Linux or MacOS
--------------

On Linux or MacOS we recommend not using your system Python and instead
managing your Python installation using `pyenv`_.

To achieve this first install `the python build environment`_, and then follow
the `pyenv installation`_ steps. Once pyenv is installed first run the following:

.. code:: cmd

    pyenv install 3.9.7

And then, after that is completed, follow it with:

.. code:: cmd

    pyenv global 3.9.7

You can choose to adjust the version number provided above to be the latest
Python version if you wish.

Installing PyMedPhys
====================

Once you have Python you can now install PyMedPhys via pip by typing the
following in a terminal or command prompt:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pymedphys[user]

You can copy this command directly into a Windows command prompt.
You can ``Right Click`` to paste.

You may need to open and close your terminal if you have only just installed
Python. The ``[user]`` option is needed to install pymedphys with its
"batteries included" so-to-speak. It will go and install a range of
dependencies which you may need during your use of pymedphys.

SSL Issues
----------

Depending on your network set up you may see "SSL" warnings followed by an
error message when trying to install PyMedPhys with the above command. This may
be due to your network administrator filtering all packets through its own
server. Pip by default protects against this as filtering of this sort can
intercept the packages to be installed and provide you with something else.

If you trust the network you are on to not be utilising this power maliciously
then you can run the following to say that you trust your network's version of
pypi.org and files.pythonhosted.org:

.. code:: bash

    pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org pymedphys[user]


.. _`pypi.org`: https://pypi.org
.. _`files.pythonhosted.org`: https://files.pythonhosted.org

Proxy Issues
------------

It's common for private networks, especially those in healthcare, to require
outgoing traffic to be sent through a proxy server to reach any servers on the
world wide web. If this is the case on your network, you will need to specify
a proxy server when using pip.

The following command specifies the proxy server for pip. Ensure you insert
your username and password used to authenticate on the proxy server, along with
the host and port of the proxy server. If you are unsure of the host and port
to use in your environment, reach out to a network administrator to obtain
these:

.. code:: bash

    pip install --proxy=http://username:password@host:port --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org pymedphys[user]
