"""A suite of functions to determine the MetersetMap for a range of
formats

.. WARNING::
   Although this is a useful tool in the toolbox for patient specific
   IMRT QA, in and of itself it is not a sufficient replacement for
   direct dosimetric measurement. This tool does not verify that the
   reported dose within the treatment planning system matches that
   delivered by the Linac.

   Deficiencies in a plan's agreement between the treatment planning
   system and the Linac due to deviations such as small field
   output factors or the MLC model will not be able to be picked up by
   this tool.

   Furthermore, when the MetersetMap is calculated off of log files
   alone this uses leaf and jaw positions as reported by the Linac which
   may not agree with their position in reality due to issues such as a
   hardware or calibration fault.
