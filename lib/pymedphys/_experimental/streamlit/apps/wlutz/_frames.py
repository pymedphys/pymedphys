"""Functions for loading up the iViewDB frame database contents.

The frame database format has changed accross the iView versions. The
older iView version has a FRAME.DBF file with all of the required
information. The new iView version spreads this information out over
nested _Frame.xml files.

To support these two database formats two functions are exposed from
this module. ``dbf_frame_based_database`` and
``xml_frame_based_database``.

    """Determine the filepaths and delivery times for each frame
    relevant to the user for a dbf based frame database.

    This is achieved by loading up the FRAME.DBF database and
    determining filename from the DBID column and delivery time by
    adjusting the image series datetime data by the DELTA_MS column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    database_directory
        The path to the iViewDB directory.
    refresh_cache
        Whether or not to reload the database caches from disk.
    filtered_table
        A filtered ``pd.DataFrame`` containing the image sequences
        relevant to the user. The column ``PIMG_DBID`` is used within
        this table to merge with the loaded FRAME database.

    Returns
    -------
    table
        A ``pandas.DataFrame`` that contains the columns "filepath",
        "time", "machine_id", "patient_id", "treatment", "port",
        "datetime", and "PIMG_DBID"

        filepath : str
            The filepath of the jpg image. Defined relative to the
            iView database directory.
        time : datetime.time
            The time of the image frame. Defined as the sum of the
            IMG_TIME column within the PATIMG database and the DELTA_MS
            column within the FRAME database. Although this information
            is available within the datetime column, this is provided
            so that the table is more informative to the user within
            the streamlit display.
        machine_id : str
            A machine identifier as defined by ORG_DTL within the
            PATIMG database.
        patient_id : str
            A patient identifier as defined by the ID column within the
            PATIENT database.
        treatment : str
            The treatment identifier as defined by the ID column within
            the TRTMNT database.
        port : str
            A port identifier as defined by the ID column within the
            PORT database.
        datetime : datetime.datetime
            The datetime representation of the image sequence start.
            Converted from the combination of the DELTA_MS columns
            within the FRAME database and the IMG_DATE and IMG_TIME
            columns within the PATIMG database.
        PIMG_DBID : int
            The DBID column from the PATIMG database.

    Notes
    -----
    If this has been run before for this given path, and
    ``refresh_cache=False``, the cached result
    for each database will be provided. The cache can be reset from the
    DBF files by passing ``refresh_cache=True``.
