Reproducible Jupyter notebook examples are provided to demonstrate PyMedPhys
library usage.

.. NOTE::

   Within each example there is a |mybinder| link.
   By using this button a live server is booted with PyMedPhys pre-installed.
   That way, without installing Python or PyMedPhys on your computer you can try out the
   usage of PyMedPhys.
