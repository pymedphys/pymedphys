    "### Beyond tab completion: wildcard matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Tab completion is useful if you know the first few characters of the object or attribute you're looking for, but is little help if you'd like to match characters at the middle or end of the word.\n",
    "For this use-case, IPython provides a means of wildcard matching for names using the ``*`` character.\n",

    "PendingDeprecationWarning     Warning\n",
    "ResourceWarning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the ``*`` character matches any string, including the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, suppose we are looking for a string method that contains the word ``find`` somewhere in its name.\n",
    "We can search for it this way:\n",
