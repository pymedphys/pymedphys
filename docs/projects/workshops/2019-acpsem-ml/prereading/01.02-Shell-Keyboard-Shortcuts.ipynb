    "If you spend any amount of time on the computer, you've probably found a use for keyboard shortcuts in your workflow.\n",
    "Most familiar perhaps are the Cmd-C and Cmd-V (or Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V) for copying and pasting in a wide variety of programs and systems.\n",
    "Power-users tend to go even further: popular text editors like Emacs, Vim, and others provide users an incredible range of operations through intricate combinations of keystrokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPython shell doesn't go this far, but does provide a number of keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation while typing commands.\n",
    "These shortcuts are not in fact provided by IPython itself, but through its dependency on the GNU Readline library: as such, some of the following shortcuts may differ depending on your system configuration.\n",
    "Also, while some of these shortcuts do work in the browser-based notebook, this section is primarily about shortcuts in the IPython shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get accustomed to these, they can be very useful for quickly performing certain commands without moving your hands from the \"home\" keyboard position.\n",
    "If you're an Emacs user or if you have experience with Linux-style shells, the following will be very familiar.\n",
    "We'll group these shortcuts into a few categories: *navigation shortcuts*, *text entry shortcuts*, *command history shortcuts*, and *miscellaneous shortcuts*."

    "This command history goes beyond your current IPython session: your entire command history is stored in a SQLite database in your IPython profile directory.\n",

    "The reverse-search can be particularly useful.\n",
