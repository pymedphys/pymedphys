    "Effective data-driven science and computation requires understanding how data is stored and manipulated.\n",
    "This section outlines and contrasts how arrays of data are handled in the Python language itself, and how NumPy improves on this.\n",
    "Understanding this difference is fundamental to understanding much of the material throughout the rest of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of Python are often drawn-in by its ease of use, one piece of which is dynamic typing.\n",
    "While a statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. For example, in C you might specify a particular operation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int result = 0;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n",
    "    result += i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While in Python the equivalent operation could be written this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    result += i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the main difference: in C, the data types of each variable are explicitly declared, while in Python the types are dynamically inferred. This means, for example, that we can assign any kind of data to any variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "x = \"four\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've switched the contents of ``x`` from an integer to a string. The same thing in C would lead (depending on compiler settings) to a compilation error or other unintented consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "x = \"four\";  // FAILS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of flexibility is one piece that makes Python and other dynamically-typed languages convenient and easy to use.\n",
    "Understanding *how* this works is an important piece of learning to analyze data efficiently and effectively with Python.\n",
    "But what this type-flexibility also points to is the fact that Python variables are more than just their value; they also contain extra information about the type of the value. We'll explore this more in the sections that follow."

    "## A Python Integer Is More Than Just an Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python implementation is written in C.\n",
    "This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as ``x = 10000``, ``x`` is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values.\n",
    "Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "struct _longobject {\n",
    "    long ob_refcnt;\n",
    "    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n",
    "    size_t ob_size;\n",
    "    long ob_digit[1];\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A single integer in Python 3.4 actually contains four pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``ob_refcnt``, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n",
    "- ``ob_type``, which encodes the type of the variable\n",
    "- ``ob_size``, which specifies the size of the following data members\n",
    "- ``ob_digit``, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",
    "\n",
