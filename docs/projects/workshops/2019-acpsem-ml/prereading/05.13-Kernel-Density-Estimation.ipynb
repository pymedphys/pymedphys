    "## Kernel Density Estimation in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The free parameters of kernel density estimation are the *kernel*, which specifies the shape of the distribution placed at each point, and the *kernel bandwidth*, which controls the size of the kernel at each point.\n",
    "In practice, there are many kernels you might use for a kernel density estimation: in particular, the Scikit-Learn KDE implementation supports one of six kernels, which you can read about in Scikit-Learn's [Density Estimation documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are several versions of kernel density estimation implemented in Python (notably in the SciPy and StatsModels packages), I prefer to use Scikit-Learn's version because of its efficiency and flexibility.\n",
    "It is implemented in the ``sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity`` estimator, which handles KDE in multiple dimensions with one of six kernels and one of a couple dozen distance metrics.\n",
    "Because KDE can be fairly computationally intensive, the Scikit-Learn estimator uses a tree-based algorithm under the hood and can trade off computation time for accuracy using the ``atol`` (absolute tolerance) and ``rtol`` (relative tolerance) parameters.\n",
    "The kernel bandwidth, which is a free parameter, can be determined using Scikit-Learn's standard cross validation tools as we will soon see.\n",

    "### Selecting the bandwidth via cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of bandwidth within KDE is extremely important to finding a suitable density estimate, and is the knob that controls the bias–variance trade-off in the estimate of density: too narrow a bandwidth leads to a high-variance estimate (i.e., over-fitting), where the presence or absence of a single point makes a large difference. Too wide a bandwidth leads to a high-bias estimate (i.e., under-fitting) where the structure in the data is washed out by the wide kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a long history in statistics of methods to quickly estimate the best bandwidth based on rather stringent assumptions about the data: if you look up the KDE implementations in the SciPy and StatsModels packages, for example, you will see implementations based on some of these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning contexts, we've seen that such hyperparameter tuning often is done empirically via a cross-validation approach.\n",
    "With this in mind, the ``KernelDensity`` estimator in Scikit-Learn is designed such that it can be used directly within the Scikit-Learn's standard grid search tools.\n",
    "Here we will use ``GridSearchCV`` to optimize the bandwidth for the preceding dataset.\n",

    "## Example: Not-So-Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "This example looks at Bayesian generative classification with KDE, and demonstrates how to use the Scikit-Learn architecture to create a custom estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [In Depth: Naive Bayes Classification](05.05-Naive-Bayes.ipynb), we took a look at naive Bayesian classification, in which we created a simple generative model for each class, and used these models to build a fast classifier.\n",
    "For Gaussian naive Bayes, the generative model is a simple axis-aligned Gaussian.\n",
    "With a density estimation algorithm like KDE, we can remove the \"naive\" element and perform the same classification with a more sophisticated generative model for each class.\n",
    "It's still Bayesian classification, but it's no longer naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach for generative classification is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the training data by label.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each set, fit a KDE to obtain a generative model of the data.\n",
    "   This allows you for any observation $x$ and label $y$ to compute a likelihood $P(x~|~y)$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. From the number of examples of each class in the training set, compute the *class prior*, $P(y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For an unknown point $x$, the posterior probability for each class is $P(y~|~x) \\propto P(x~|~y)P(y)$.\n",
    "   The class which maximizes this posterior is the label assigned to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is straightforward and intuitive to understand; the more difficult piece is couching it within the Scikit-Learn framework in order to make use of the grid search and cross-validation architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the code that implements the algorithm within the Scikit-Learn framework; we will step through it following the code block:"
