    "\n",
    "- **Physical boundaries and bodies of water**\n",

    "  - ``drawmapscale()``: Draw a linear scale on the map\n",

    "- **Whole-globe images**\n",
    "  - ``bluemarble()``: Project NASA's blue marble image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``shadedrelief()``: Project a shaded relief image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``etopo()``: Draw an etopo relief image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``warpimage()``: Project a user-provided image onto the map\n",
    "\n",
    "For the boundary-based features, you must set the desired resolution when creating a Basemap image.\n",

    "In addition to this, there are many map-specific functions available as methods of the ``Basemap`` instance.\n",
    "These work very similarly to their standard Matplotlib counterparts, but have an additional Boolean argument ``latlon``, which if set to ``True`` allows you to pass raw latitudes and longitudes to the method, rather than projected ``(x, y)`` coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these map-specific methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``contour()``/``contourf()`` : Draw contour lines or filled contours\n",
    "- ``imshow()``: Draw an image\n",
    "- ``pcolor()``/``pcolormesh()`` : Draw a pseudocolor plot for irregular/regular meshes\n",
    "- ``plot()``: Draw lines and/or markers.\n",
