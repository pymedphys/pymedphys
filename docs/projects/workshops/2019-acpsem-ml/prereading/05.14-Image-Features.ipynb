    "This chapter has explored a number of the central concepts and algorithms of machine learning.\n",
    "But moving from these concepts to real-world application can be a challenge.\n",
    "Real-world datasets are noisy and heterogeneous, may have missing features, and data may be in a form that is difficult to map to a clean ``[n_samples, n_features]`` matrix.\n",
    "Before applying any of the methods discussed here, you must first extract these features from your data: there is no formula for how to do this that applies across all domains, and thus this is where you as a data scientist must exercise your own intuition and expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting and compelling application of machine learning is to images, and we have already seen a few examples of this where pixel-level features are used for classification.\n",
    "In the real world, data is rarely so uniform and simple pixels will not be suitable: this has led to a large literature on *feature extraction* methods for image data (see [Feature Engineering](05.04-Feature-Engineering.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will take a look at one such feature extraction technique, the [Histogram of Oriented Gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) (HOG), which transforms image pixels into a vector representation that is sensitive to broadly informative image features regardless of confounding factors like illumination.\n",

    "The Histogram of Gradients is a straightforward feature extraction procedure that was developed in the context of identifying pedestrians within images.\n",
    "HOG involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optionally pre-normalize images. This leads to features that resist dependence on variations in illumination.\n",
    "2. Convolve the image with two filters that are sensitive to horizontal and vertical brightness gradients. These capture edge, contour, and texture information.\n",
    "3. Subdivide the image into cells of a predetermined size, and compute a histogram of the gradient orientations within each cell.\n",
    "4. Normalize the histograms in each cell by comparing to the block of neighboring cells. This further suppresses the effect of illumination across the image.\n",
    "5. Construct a one-dimensional feature vector from the information in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fast HOG extractor is built into the Scikit-Image project, and we can try it out relatively quickly and visualize the oriented gradients within each cell:"

    "## Caveats and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "If you dig a bit deeper into the preceding code and examples, you'll see that we still have a bit of work before we can claim a production-ready face detector.\n",
    "There are several issues with what we've done, and several improvements that could be made. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our training set, especially for negative features, is not very complete\n",
    "\n",
    "The central issue is that there are many face-like textures that are not in the training set, and so our current model is very prone to false positives.\n",
    "You can see this if you try out the above algorithm on the *full* astronaut image: the current model leads to many false detections in other regions of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might imagine addressing this by adding a wider variety of images to the negative training set, and this would probably yield some improvement.\n",
    "Another way to address this is to use a more directed approach, such as *hard negative mining*.\n",
    "In hard negative mining, we take a new set of images that our classifier has not seen, find all the patches representing false positives, and explicitly add them as negative instances in the training set before re-training the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our current pipeline searches only at one scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As currently written, our algorithm will miss faces that are not approximately 62Ã—47 pixels.\n",
    "This can be straightforwardly addressed by using sliding windows of a variety of sizes, and re-sizing each patch using ``skimage.transform.resize`` before feeding it into the model.\n",
    "In fact, the ``sliding_window()`` utility used here is already built with this in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We should combine overlapped detection patches\n",
    "\n",
    "For a production-ready pipeline, we would prefer not to have 30 detections of the same face, but to somehow reduce overlapping groups of detections down to a single detection.\n",
    "This could be done via an unsupervised clustering approach (MeanShift Clustering is one good candidate for this), or via a procedural approach such as *non-maximum suppression*, an algorithm common in machine vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The pipeline should be streamlined\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we address these issues, it would also be nice to create a more streamlined pipeline for ingesting training images and predicting sliding-window outputs.\n",
    "This is where Python as a data science tool really shines: with a bit of work, we could take our prototype code and package it with a well-designed object-oriented API that give the user the ability to use this easily.\n",
    "I will leave this as a proverbial \"exercise for the reader\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### More recent advances: Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I should add that HOG and other procedural feature extraction methods for images are no longer state-of-the-art techniques.\n",
    "Instead, many modern object detection pipelines use variants of deep neural networks: one way to think of neural networks is that they are an estimator which determines optimal feature extraction strategies from the data, rather than relying on the intuition of the user.\n",
    "An intro to these deep neural net methods is conceptually (and computationally!) beyond the scope of this section, although open tools like Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) have recently made deep learning approaches much more accessible than they once were.\n",
    "As of the writing of this book, deep learning in Python is still relatively young, and so I can't yet point to any definitive resource.\n",
    "That said, the list of references in the following section should provide a useful place to start!"
