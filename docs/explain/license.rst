Benefits of using a copyleft license in Medical Physics
-------------------------------------------------------

For more information on why Medical Physicists might choose to use the
AGPL-3.0+ license, please read the
`the Benefits of AGPL-3.0+ for Medical Physics`_.


Justification for the inclusion of additional terms
---------------------------------------------------

A significant and justifiable fear within the Medical Physics community is that
the authors of any shared code may be liable for negligence, damages or harm
caused by the shared code.

Within Australian courts, if there is any ambiguity in liability exclusion
clauses, such clauses will be interpreted narrowly. I.e., if liability is not
carefully, explicitly excluded in the licence, liability may not be interpreted
as excluded within an Australian court
(see https://eprints.qut.edu.au/7404/1/open_source_book.pdf page 80).

The AGPL-3.0+ does not explicitly mention negligence anywhere within its
license text. However, the Apache-2.0 licence does. Moreover, the AGPL-3.0+ in
Section 7 does define allowable additional terms. The negligence clauses within
the Apache-2.0 fall under these allowable additional terms and have been
included in the PyMedPhys licence. Other desirable features of the Apache-2.0
license - such as contribution, trademark, and warranty requirements - have
also been included.

A note about the code sharing license requirement
-------------------------------------------------

If you only ever use this code internally within your company to create
your own programs, the only people who need to have access to the source code
are those users to whom you distribute the program. You are under no obligation
to share your code outside of your company if your only users are within your
company.

That said, there are very good reasons for you to share your code with members
of the Medical Physics community and beyond! For more information, please read
`the Benefits of AGPL-3.0+ for Medical Physics`_.
