Benefits of using a copyleft license in Medical Physics
-------------------------------------------------------

For more information on why you as a Medical Physicist might want to use the
AGPL-3.0+ license read the `the Benefits of AGPL-3.0+ for Medical Physics`_.

Justification for the inclusion of additional terms
---------------------------------------------------

A significant and justifiable fear within the Medical Physics community is that
should code be shared the author of the code may be liable for negligence.

Within Australian courts if there is any ambiguity in liability exclusion
clauses they will be interpreted narrowly. If liability for negligence is not
expressly excluded it may not be read as excluded within an Australian court
(https://eprints.qut.edu.au/7404/1/open_source_book.pdf page 80).
The same is true for clauses which seek to exclude liability for consequential
loss.

The AGPL-3.0+ (nor the MIT license) does not explicitly mention negligence
anywhere within its license text. The Apache-2.0 does. The AGPL-3.0+ in Section 7 does define
allowable additional terms. The negligence clauses within the Apache-2.0 fall
under these allowable additional terms so, as such, they have been included.

There are also other desirable features of the Apache-2.0 license such as
contribution, trademark, and warranty requirements. These were also included.

A note about the code sharing license requirement
-------------------------------------------------

If you only ever use this code internally within your company to create
your own programs the only people who need to have access to the source code are those users
whom you distribute the program to. Therefore you do not need to share your
code outside of your company if your only users are within your company.

However there are significant benefits from sharing your code with the
community. Please read `the Benefits of AGPL-3.0+ for Medical Physics`_.
