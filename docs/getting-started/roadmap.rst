Here will be recorded the roadmap for the future development of PyMedPhys.


Graphical User Interface (GUI)
------------------------------

A goal of the graphical user interface is to have it customisable, and
expandable. It is envisioned that the not yet released
`JupyterLab Dashboarding`_ might provide a perfect environment for building
GUIs that can be easily extended by the community.

To progress in this direction we need to begin building `Jupyter Widgets`_ that
would become the dashboarding building blocks. An example of one of these
widgets that could be expanded on are the `ITK Jupyter Widgets`_.
