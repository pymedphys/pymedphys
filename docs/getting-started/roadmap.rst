Here will be recorded the roadmap for the future development of PyMedPhys.


Graphical User Interface (GUI)
------------------------------

A goal of the graphical user interface is to have it customisable, and
expandable. We envision that the as yet unreleased
`JupyterLab Dashboarding`_ could provide a perfect environment for building
GUIs that can be easily extended by the community.

To progress in this direction, we need to begin building `Jupyter Widgets`_ that
serve as the building blocks of JupyterLab Dashboarding. See the `ITK Jupyter Widgets`_
for a nice example of this approach.
