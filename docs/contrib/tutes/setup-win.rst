Assumptions
-----------

These instructions assume that you are using a Windows machine and that
you have administrator rights on your machine. Although this document
is tailored to Windows users, PyMedPhys itself works on Windows, macOS
and Linux.


Get Python & Anaconda
---------------------

Anaconda is a free, open source, optimized Python (and R) distrubution. It
includes:

- `conda <https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`__, a powerful package and
  environment management system.
- Python
- Over 100 automatically installed scientific packages (`numpy`, `scipy`, etc.)
  that have been tested to work well together, along with their dependencies.

Download the latest Anaconda Python **3** version from
`here <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__

When installing Anaconda make sure to install it for your user only, and tick
the option “add to path”.

You might notice that Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can be installed
via the Anaconda installation. However, we recommend installing VS Code from
its official install distribution as outlined below in
:ref:`text-editor-section`. The Anaconda installer does not provide the
opportunity to tick the “Open with Code” boxes detailed below.

Once you have installed Anaconda, add the conda-forge channel to your machine
using the following command in a new command prompt:

.. code:: bash

    conda config --add channels conda-forge



.. _text-editor-section:

Get a text editor - VS Code
---------------------------

Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is an excellent, free, open-source code editor.
It comes with many great features for both Python and Git. You can download
the official release `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__.

When installing VS Code, make sure to tick the “Open with Code” boxes:

.. image:: /img/open_with_code.png

You will need to install a few extensions in VS Code to complete your set up.
This is very easy to do via the Extensions Marketplace once VS Code is
installed. With VS Code running, access the marketplace by clicking this symbol
on the left toolbar:

.. image:: /img/vscode_extensions.png

Search for the "Anaconda Extension Pack" and install it. Reload VS Code when
installation has finished and you're ready to go with Python in VS Code!

We also recommend the "GitLens" extension to further enhance your VS Code
experience! It comes with a number of useful tools for using Git within VS
Code itself.



Get a (good) terminal - Cmder
-----------------------------

Cmder is a great terminal that fills the massive gap on Windows machines.
One would think that syntax highlighting, copy/paste, and window resizing would
be commonplace in terminals everywhere - but apparently not! Cmder to the
rescue! Install the mini version of cmder from `here <http://cmder.net/>`__.

Once you've downloaded cmder, follow the steps given
`here <https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder#shortcut-to-open-cmder-in-a-chosen-folder>`__
to obtain the ability to open a terminal in any directory by right clicking in
the file browser.



Get a package manager (for Windows users) - Chocolatey
------------------------------------------------------

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It makes installing software
development tools quite a breeze. Follow
`these instructions <https://chocolatey.org/install>`__ to install Chocolatey.



.. _system-dependencies-section:

Install contributor system dependencies
---------------------------------------

Use Chocolatey within an administrator command prompt to install Git,
yarn, and graphviz like so:

.. code:: bash

    choco install git nodejs yarn graphviz.portable



Configure Git and get a GitHub account
--------------------------------------

If you successfully completed the instructions in
:ref:`system-dependencies-section`, you should now have Git installed. It is
probably worth spending some time configuring Git according to your
preferences - you can find a good beginners' resource on this
`here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>`__.
There are lots of useful tips and tricks that can improve your Git experience.
At a minimum, we do recommend you set your username and email from within a
terminal as follows:

.. code:: bash

    git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
    git config --global user.email "example@example.com"

Make a GitHub account `here <https://github.com/join>`__. Once you have an
account, you will need commit rights to this repository in order to make
contributions. Create an issue on GitHub within the PyMedPhys repository
`here <https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/issues/new/>`__
and include "request for commit rights" or similar in your issue's content,
along with "@SimonBiggs" and "@Matthew-Jennings" to ensure it is seen!

Whenever you wish to discuss anything about PyMedPhys, please create an issue
on GitHub. It can be to ask for help, suggest a change, provide feedback, or
anything else regarding PyMedPhys. Write "@" followed by someone's username if
you would like to talk to someone specifically.

The real power of GitHub comes from Git itself. A great piece of Git
documentation can be found
`here <https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html>`__.
Use this documentation to begin to get a feel for what Git is.



Peruse some useful resources
----------------------------

At this point you might find some of the following resources useful:

 * `Numpy for Matlab users (Scipy.org) <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`__.
 * `NumPy for MATLAB users (Mathesaurus) <http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html>`__.
 * `Playground and cheatsheet for learning Python <https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python>`__.
 * `Don't be afraid to commit: Git and GitHub <https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html>`__.
 * Chapter 2 of `The Pragmatic Programmer <https://www.nceclusters.no/globalassets/filer/nce/diverse/the-pragmatic-programmer.pdf>`__.

The "Don't be afraid to commit" resource will be invaluable for these next few
steps.



Authenticate your computer to be able to access your GitHub account
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before setting your SSH keys, I recommend permanently setting your HOME
variable. This can clear up some potentially confusing issues. Do this by
running the following where `yourusername` is your Windows domain user name.

.. code:: bash

    setx HOME "C:\Users\yourusername"

Follow `these instructions <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/>`__
to create and add an SSH key to your GitHub account. Since you already have ssh
built into cmder, you can skip the first steps of the tutorial.

If all has gone well you should be able to run the following without being
prompted for a password.

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:pymedphys/pymedphys.git
    cd pymedphys

This will download all of PyMedPhys to your local machine.

If you find that you cannot connect to GitHub via SSH (possibly due to
IT restrictions at your institution), you can also clone via HTTPS as follows:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys.git


Set up *nbstripout*
-------------------

``nbstripout`` is used to make it so that you do not post Jupyter Notebook
outputs online. Depending on how you use notebooks these outputs may
contain private and/or sensitive information.

.. WARNING::

    In the event that you uninstall Python, it is possible that ``nbstripout``
    ends up disabled. Stay prudent, and be extra cautious when working with
    sensitive information stored within a notebook in a Git repository.

To install ``nbstripout``, run the following within the pymedphys directory:

.. code:: bash

    λ conda create --name pmp python=3.7 shapely nbstripout
    λ conda activate pmp
    λ nbstripout --install
    λ nbstripout --is-installed && echo Success!
    Success!

Make sure that ``"Success!"`` was actually printed after running the last
command. If nothing printed, ``nbstripout`` did not successfully install.

The ``conda`` commands create, activate and install ``nbstripout`` within an
isolated conda environment called ``pmp``. Working within the ``pmp``
environment allows you to more safely write code without breaking other python
installations or running into python package incompatibilities. For more on
working with conda environments, see `Managing environments`_ in the Conda
docs.

.. _`Managing environments`: https://conda-forge.org/



Install the development version of PyMedPhys
--------------------------------------------

Begin by installing the dependencies of the online version of PyMedPhys with
conda. With cmder open in the pymedphys directory, run:

.. code:: bash

    yarn bootstrap



Update this document
--------------------

.. note::

    If you've made it this far, well done!

Now that you've got this far, you have a copy of the code on your machine.

First thing's first: make a branch. If you don't know what that is, head on
back over to
`Don't be afraid to commit <https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html>`__
and scrub up on your terminology.

To make a branch, open cmder in the pymedphys directory and run the following:

.. code:: bash

    git checkout -b yourinitials-edit-contributing-document

Once you've run that you are now free to make some changes.

Right click on the top level pymedphys directory, and press "Open with Code".
This document that you're reading is located at
``docs/developer/contributing.rst``. Use VS Code to navigate to that file and
begin making your changes.

Once your changes are complete, reopen your cmder and run:

.. code:: bash

    git add -A
    git commit -m "my first commit"
    git push --set-upstream origin your-name-edit-contributing-document

Now, you have successfully sent your branch online.

Now you need to open a pull request. Open one `here
<https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/compare>`__, select the source
branch to be ``pymedphys/your-name-edit-contributing-document`` and set the
target branch to be ``pymedphys/master``.

At that point, we'll get notified and we can begin discussing the changes
you've made.

Thank you! Welcome to the team!
