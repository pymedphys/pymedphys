Git and pandoc
..............

Use the following links to install git and pandoc.

* `Install git`_
* `Install pandoc`_

If you don't have admin access make sure to install within your user account.
When installing git it will ask you what default text editor to use. If you
don't know what ``vim`` is make sure to change the default setting from ``vim``
to VSCode (that was just installed).


Install poetry
..............

To install Poetry run the following within a command prompt:

.. code:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

What this does is detailed in the `Install Poetry`_ docs. You will need to
close and reopen your command prompt after installing Poetry.


Install the development version of PyMedPhys and pre-commit
-----------------------------------------------------------

To download a copy of the PyMedPhys repository onto your machine run:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys.git

Then change into the newly created directory by running:

.. code:: bash

    cd pymedphys

Then install PyMedPhys and set up pre-commit by running:

.. code:: bash

    poetry install
    poetry run pre-commit install


Install a Jupyter Lab kernel for the development install
--------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name pymedphys-master
