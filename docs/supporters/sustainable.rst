PyMedPhys is supported by companies through employee developer time as well as
the purchasing of advertising space. This is a fundamental part of PyMedPhys
having an open and vibrant future.

As the quality and breadth of PyMedPhys grows this attracts Medical Physicists
to use these quality free tools provided by it. As Medical Physicists are
attracted to the platform, we serve non-intrusive relevent advertising on
behalf of our `supporters <supporters.html>`_. This produces revenue for
PyMedPhys, revenue which is fed back into directly supporting the PyMedPhys
community in ways which allow more Medical Physicists to contribute quality
code.

More quality code |rarr| More users |rarr| More support & contributors |rarr|
More quality code.

A virtuous cycle designed to make PyMedPhys be supported and maintained while
also being free and open source, now and into the future.
