Project Maintenance
-------------------

In its current form, at the time of writing, there are five contributors, two
of these are also maintainers. Project maintenance encompasses tasks such as

* reviewing code,
* building and maintaining project infrastructure,
* iterating and improving continuous integration and deployment pipelines,
* creating releases on PyPI and Conda-Forge,
* providing support, as well as
* addressing bug reports and issues.

At this current point in time the lion share of PyMedPhys maintenance is
undergone by the maintainers in their own time, out side of work hours, simply
because they love it, and believe in what PyMedPhys aims to become.

For PyMedPhys to become what what we dream for it to be it will one day have
100s of contributors from timezones all over the world, as well as 1000s of
feedback requests. As well as timely releases, with tight testing and
deployment. The maintenance of a project that large will not be sustainable
should it be done entirely out of work hours.

For PyMedPhys to become sustainable and to grow into what it needs to become
for Medical Physicists all around world, PyMedPhys needs to grow into the
position to be able to employ a full time project maintainer paying the wage
of a high quality senior software engineer position. We are no where
near there yet. In fact, at the time of writing we don't yet have any paying
supporters. But, the plan is to change that.

The aim is to build revenue via advertising, and advertising that does not
detract from the user experience. Watch this space as we aim to turn PyMedPhys
into a sustainable open source project to last into the future.


The Plan
--------

Implement non-intrusive advertising within the bottom of the navigation panel.
Provide a user friendly and integrated way for companies who want to become
supporters to bid for ad placement.

Have all advertising be based upon `viewable impressions
<https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/viewability/#/demo>`_
using `a transparent open source viewability library
<https://kahwee.github.io/viewability/timer.html>`_. Specifically exclude
charging for advertising from any user who is a maintainer of the project.

Say thank you to our supporters, at no extra cost, via
`the supporters page <supporters.html>`_ making it clear that we appreciate
their partnership with us.

Make all revenue public, open and transparent.

Once a suite of quality applications have been built provide ways for users to
pay for support contracts which come in two tiers, phone support and on-site
support.
