Sustainable Open Source
=======================

PyMedPhys is supported by companies through employee developer time as well as
the purchasing advertising space. This is a fundamental part of PyMedPhys
having an open and vibrant future.

As the quality and breadth of PyMedPhys grows this attracts Medical Physicists
to use the quality, free tools it provides. As Medical Physicists are attracted
to the platform we serve **non-intrusive** relevent advertising on behalf of
our `supporters <supporters>`_. This produces revenue for PyMedPhys, revenue
which is fed back into directly supporting the PyMedPhys community in ways
which allow more Medical Physicsits to contribute quality code.
