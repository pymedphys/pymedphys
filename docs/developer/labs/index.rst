.. CAUTION::

    Here are some experimental modules that have been written by both members
    of the community and maintainers of pymedphys. They have not yet undergone
    either sufficient testing, review, or refinement to be included within
    pymedphys proper. Consider everything under this module to be always at
    an "alpha" level of development. Consider that from any version to any
    version of pymedphys release these modules may change in such a way that
    breaks code that depends on it. Changes within the labs are not tracked
    within the changelogs.

Each experimental module is organised by author below:
