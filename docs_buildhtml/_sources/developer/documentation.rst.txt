Editing documentation
=====================

This documentation site uses a toolbox called Sphinx. This particular document
aims to help contributors to improve the PyMedPhys documentation.

It presumes you have gone through the base contributing documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------
To work on the documentation on your machine you will need the following extra
libraries installed:

.. code:: bash

    pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild numpydoc sphinx_rtd_theme


Starting a live update documentation server
-------------------------------------------
Within the root pymedphys directory run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html

Then within a web browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

You may now edit the documentation within the docs directory and see the
changes live update within your browser.


Docstring extraction
--------------------
Some documentation is best written right within a given function itself. This
type of documentation is called a **docstring**. However, this documentation should
also be available in the main documentation and it is exceptionally important that
this isn't written more than once. Duplicating documentation increases
`software entropy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy>`__. As time goes by,
documentation updates may result in one or more copies being missed and becoming
obsolete or inconsistent with the up-to-date copy. Even if all copies are updated correctly,
unnecessary duplication adds to ongoing maintenance requirements. See the `DRY programming
philosophy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__ for more on this.

To solve this problem, most of PyMedPhys' documentation is written as docstrings,
which are then automatically extracted into the main documentation pages. For this
to work properly, docstrings need to be formatted according to the numpy style. See
the following sites for examples of how to conform to that style:

- `Napoleon Docs - Example NumPy Style Python Docstrings <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy>`__
- `numpydoc docstring guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__

See existing examples within PyMedPhys for how to include new function docstrings
into the main PyMedPhys documentation.
