## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure

PyMedPhys is a medical physics library organized as follows:

- **lib/pymedphys/**: Main library code
  - `_<module>/`: Private implementation modules (e.g., `_dicom/`, `_gamma/`, `_mosaiq/`)
  - `<module>.py`: Public API modules that expose the private implementations
  - `cli/`: Command-line interface implementations
  - `tests/`: Test suite organized by module
  - `_experimental/`: Experimental features not yet stable
  - `_streamlit/`: Streamlit web app components

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Private/Public Module Pattern**: Implementation details are in `_module/` directories, with public APIs exposed through `module.py` files at the package root.

2. **Delivery Abstraction**: The `Delivery` class (`_base/delivery.py`) provides a unified interface for treatment delivery data from various sources (DICOM, TRF files, Mosaiq, Monaco).

3. **CLI Architecture**: The CLI is modular with subcommands defined in `cli/` subdirectory. Each major feature has its own CLI module (e.g., `dicom_cli`, `trf_cli`).

4. **Data Management**:
   - External data is managed through Zenodo with hashes stored in `_data/hashes.json`
   - The `_data` module provides utilities for downloading and caching external datasets

5. **Vendor-Specific Integrations**:
   - **Mosaiq**: SQL-based integration for Elekta's oncology information system
   - **Monaco**: Support for Elekta Monaco treatment planning system files
   - **Pinnacle**: DICOM export functionality for Philips Pinnacle
   - **iCOM**: Real-time treatment delivery monitoring for Elekta linacs

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests are in `lib/pymedphys/tests/` mirroring the source structure
- Tests use pytest with fixtures defined in `conftest.py`
- Mock data and fixtures are in `_mocks/` and test data directories
- E2E tests use Cypress for Streamlit app testing

### Dependencies and Extras

The project uses Poetry with optional dependency groups:
- `user`: Standard user installation
- `all`: All features including development tools
- `dev`: Development tools (linting, formatting)
- `docs`: Documentation building
- `tests`: Testing dependencies
- Specific features: `dicom`, `mosaiq`, `icom`, etc.

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Beta Status**: PyMedPhys is in beta (version 0.x.x). APIs may change between releases.

2. **DICOM Handling**: The library provides extensive DICOM functionality including anonymization, coordinate systems, dose calculations, and RT plan manipulation.

3. **Gamma Analysis**: Core functionality for dose distribution comparison using efficient shell-based algorithm implementation.

4. **Anthropic Integration**: Built-in Claude integration for AI-assisted features (requires API key).

5. **Streamlit Apps**: Web-based tools for various tasks (anonymization, metersetmap, dose analysis) in `_streamlit/apps/`.

6. **Database Connections**: Mosaiq integration requires appropriate database credentials and SQL Server access.

## Common Development Patterns

When implementing new features:

1. Place implementation in appropriate `_module/` directory
2. Expose public API through module-level `__init__.py` or dedicated public module
3. Add corresponding CLI command if user-facing
4. Include comprehensive tests following existing patterns
5. Use type hints and follow existing code style
6. Document with docstrings following NumPy style

When modifying DICOM functionality, be aware of:
- Coordinate system transformations
- Anonymization requirements
- VR (Value Representation) handling
- RT-specific DICOM objects (RTDose, RTPlan, RTStruct)

## Bash Command Restrictions

**IMPORTANT**: When Claude Code has restricted bash permissions (via `allowed_tools`), command chaining with `&` or `&&` is NOT allowed.

### The Problem
If the allowed_tools configuration specifies individual bash commands like:
```yaml
Bash(git add file.txt),
Bash(git commit -m "message")
```

This does NOT allow chained commands like:
- ❌ `git add file.txt && git commit -m "message"`
- ❌ `command1 & command2`
- ❌ `command1 ; command2`

Each `Bash(command)` entry is treated as an exact string match for a single command only.

### The Solution
Execute commands sequentially instead of chaining:
1. Execute the first command
2. Check the result
3. If successful, execute the next command

This approach prioritizes security over efficiency, ensuring that only explicitly allowed commands can be executed.

## Maintainer Guidance Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: When maintainers provide specific guidance or preferences during PR reviews or issue discussions, that guidance must be permanently added to this CLAUDE.md file.

### Why This Matters
- Prevents repeated explanations of the same preferences
- Ensures consistent behavior across all Claude Code interactions
- Documents project-specific conventions and requirements
- Builds institutional knowledge that persists across sessions

### What to Document
- Security preferences (like the bash command restrictions above)
- Code style preferences not captured by linters
- Workflow preferences (e.g., when to create PRs, how to handle commits)
- Testing requirements or patterns
- Any other maintainer feedback that would apply to future work

### How to Update
When a maintainer provides guidance:
1. Complete the requested task
2. Add the guidance to the appropriate section in this file
3. If no appropriate section exists, create a new one
4. Commit the updated CLAUDE.md along with other changes
