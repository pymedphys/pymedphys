**A community effort to develop an open standard library for Medical Physics
in Python. We build high quality, transparent software together via peer review
and open source distribution. Open code is better science.**

What is PyMedPhys?
==================

PyMedPhys is an open-source Medical Physics python library built by an open
community that values and prioritises code sharing, review, improvement, and
learning from each other. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our
physics peers in astronomy and the `Astropy Project`_. PyMedPhys is available
on `PyPI`_ and `GitHub`_.

PyMedPhys first paper in the Journal of Open Source Software contains more
background information, including a statement of need. You can access the paper
`here <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04555>`_. When referencing

Beta level of development
*************************

PyMedPhys is currently within the ``beta`` stage of its life-cycle. It will
stay in this stage until the version number leaves ``0.x.x`` and enters
``1.x.x``. While PyMedPhys is in ``beta`` stage, **no API is guaranteed to be
stable from one release to the next.** In fact, it is very likely that the
entire API will change multiple times before a ``1.0.0`` release. In practice,
this means that upgrading ``pymedphys`` to a new version will possibly break
any code that was using the old version of pymedphys. We try to be abreast of
this by providing details of any breaking changes from one release to the next
within the `Release Notes`_.

Community
**************

PyMedPhys has a `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys/discussions>`_
page to both help you find your feet using PyMedPhys and to facilitate collaboration
and general discussion. Please reach out over there and we'd love to get to
know you!

Documentation
=============

PyMedPhys can be installed with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pymedphys[user]

Further user installation instructions can be found in the `Quick Start Guide`_.

The PyMedPhys documentation contains two overarching guides:

1. **The Users Guide**: where you can find instructions to `get started`_ with
   the library and the CLI, in-depth `how-to guides`_ (examples for users) on PyMedPhys' various
   tools, some `background information`_ on individual PyMedPhys projects as
   well as the `Technical Reference`_.

2. **The Contributors Guide**: for those who wish to make new contributions
   to the PyMedPhys library, CLI or app. Here you'll find detailed `workstation
   setup guides`_ to enable contributions, important `repository information`_,
   and some `tips & tricks`_ to overcome common issues.

Development
=============

The PyMedPhys project is managed using `Poetry`_.

After cloning the repository, install the PyMedPhys dependencies and set up pre-commit by running:

.. code:: bash

    poetry install -E all
    poetry run pre-commit install

Run automated tests with:

.. code:: bash

    poetry run pymedphys dev tests

   Unfortunately :target: being a variable name is no longer supported by
   GitHub within README.rst files. So... unfortunately we have some duplication
